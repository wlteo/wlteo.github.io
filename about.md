Hello, I am Evan. After bouncing around different blogging platforms, this is where I'd like to start again. 

I was previously doing paid traffic acquisition for one of the largest travel sites in the world where I was very fortunate to work with a bunch of smart cookies. I loved the data driven environment where everything was measured, tested and evaluated. 

But things got a little boring after a while so I took a break and enrolled myself into a coding bootcamp where I learned everything from how the web works to how to build and deploy web applications that everyone could visit and use. The ability to create something I could call my own and that everyone could use was amazing. The bootcamp was only the beginning and I plan to continue learning and honing my skills to build bigger and better things.
